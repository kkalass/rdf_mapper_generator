A code generation tool for creating type-safe, boilerplate-free RDF mappers in Dart. Automatically converts between Dart objects and RDF (Resource Description Framework) data by processing annotations from rdf_mapper_annotations. Supports global and local resources, IRI templates, custom type mappings, collections, and complex object graphs while maintaining high performance and type safety.

## Overview

[üåê **Official Homepage**](https://kkalass.github.io/rdf_mapper_generator/)

`rdf_mapper_generator` provides the builder that takes classes annotated with the annotations from `rdf_mapper_annotations` and generates Mappers for use with `rdf_mapper` project.

## Part of a Family of Projects

This library is part of a comprehensive ecosystem for working with RDF in Dart:

* [rdf_core](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_core) - Core graph classes and serialization (Turtle, JSON-LD, N-Triples)
* [rdf_mapper](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_mapper) - Base mapping system between Dart objects and RDF
* [rdf_mapper_generator](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_mapper_generator) - Code generator for this annotation library
* [rdf_vocabularies](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_vocabularies) - Constants for common RDF vocabularies (Schema.org, FOAF, etc.)
* [rdf_xml](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_xml) - RDF/XML format support
* [rdf_vocabulary_to_dart](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_vocabulary_to_dart) - Generate constants for custom vocabularies

## Recent Changes

### Model Class Refactoring

We've refactored the model classes to store complete annotation instances instead of individual fields. This change provides several benefits:

- **Better encapsulation**: The complete annotation data is preserved
- **Future-proof**: New annotation properties are automatically available
- **Consistency**: Uniform access to all annotation data

#### Key Changes:

1. **GlobalResourceInfo** now stores the complete `RdfGlobalResource` annotation
2. **PropertyInfo** now stores the complete `RdfProperty` annotation
3. Added computed getters for backward compatibility
4. Updated processors to create and handle complete annotation instances
